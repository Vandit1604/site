## Failing Forward

Failure is often seen as a dead-end, but it's actually an opportunity for growth. When things don’t go as planned, it’s not the end; it’s a chance to build a foundation for your next step.

### Types of Failure

1. **Stagnant Failure**: Failing without learning anything new. You’re left in the same place, without progress or lessons learned.
   
2. **Progressive Failure**: Failing forward, where each failure helps you build a foundation to avoid starting from zero the next time. This type of failure is invaluable because it sets you up to move closer to success.

### Avoiding Stagnant Failure

A failure without progress is a missed opportunity. For example, starting a project but leaving it unfinished yields little value. To gain from failure, aim to complete what you start—even if it doesn’t work out—so you walk away with lessons learned.

### The Danger of Half-Knowledge

The concept of “half-knowledge” is illustrated in the Indian epic, Mahabharata, through the story of Abhimanyu. While still in his mother Subhadra’s womb, Abhimanyu learned the correct process to penetrate the Chakravyuh, a complex battle formation, from his father Arjuna. However, Arjuna did not complete the instructions, leaving Abhimanyu with only half-knowledge of the Chakravyuh.

This mythological example highlights the importance of completeness and thoroughness in knowledge acquisition. Half-knowledge, in this context, is depicted as potentially dangerous or ineffective.

### TL;DR

- Failing at something means you are consistent at something. This is good.
- After failing, don't get depressed but gather the lessons you learned from the failure. 
- After working on something for months, even then people fail. Focus on what you learnt in the process that you're deeming a failure now. 
- Learn the "Why you failed" and Come up with the "How you will pass next time"

**This is my ideology that keeps me going when I fail at something *but do we ever fail at something* ;)**

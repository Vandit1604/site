If you're in your first year or a beginner in tech and want to build a strong foundation in tech, here's a roadmap to follow. These are the essential things I would recommend you learn to get better at tech.

## 1. Pick a Programming Language

Choose one of the "big three" languages:

### **Python**
> Great for Development and DSA.

### **Java**
> Great for Development and DSA.

### **C++**
> Great for DSA not so easy for Development but it is possible. You can do your own research here.

### What to Learn:

- Start with the basics and progress until you understand **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.
- Head over to [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard).
- Scroll down to **Prepare by Topics** and start solving exercises in the language you picked.

## 2. Practice and Implementation

- **Build Something:** Apply what you've learned. Even if it’s as simple as a program that takes input and prints output in the terminal—**building something** is crucial.

**Exercise**: 

> **NOTE:** Use whatever language you like and whatever data structures you want or any approach you like. This exercise is to write code and make a working prototype as soon as possible. There's no correct answer to programming that's the beauty of it.

1. Build a To-Do app which takes input from the CLI something like below.  

  * When someone adds a todo return a todo ID. This ID will be used later. 
    ```sh
    ./todo add <todo-name> <categories>
    added todo with todo-id #1
    ```

  * User should be able to mark todo's as complete from the CLI as well
    ```sh
    ./todo done <todo-id>   
    ```

  * User should be able to list all the todos
    ```
    ./todo list 
    ```

  * User should be able to search todos with 
    - todo-id
    - todo-name
    - todo-category

    ```
    ./todo search <todo-id>   
    ./todo search <todo-name>   
    ./todo search <todo-category>   
    ```

    After this you should go ahead the extra mile and implement search in categories.
    ```
    ./todo search <todo-category> <todo-name>
    ```

This is a basic project but if done right. You'll see programming in a new light.
 
The final Implementation should have these thing done right. All of these are must haves:
- Validation if two same todo's are not added
- searching should be precise
- Error handling
- Use OOPs concepts

## 3. Pick a Domain You Like

After getting comfortable with a language, explore different tech domains. Some examples include:

- **Backend Development**
- **Frontend Development**
- **Full Stack Development**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Artificial Intelligence**
- **...etcetra etcetra**

Role based roadmaps on https://roadmap.sh/ translate to job role. You can definitely use it as your syllabus/roadmap ;)

## 4. Learn from YouTube, Avoid Paid Courses

YouTube is your best friend. Don’t waste money on paid courses, especially in your first year or beginner phase.

### Warning:
Avoid most Indian creators—some love to gaslight and push paid courses. While there are a few good ones, **no course will truly be beneficial for you in the first year**. You need to focus on hands-on learning.

## 5. Explore Domains That Translate to Job Roles

Each domain directly translates into a real-world job:

- **Frontend Development** → Frontend Engineer
- **Backend Development** → Backend Engineer
- **Machine Learning** → ML Engineer
- And so on...

Spend **one week** exploring a domain by coding and building projects. If you're not building something, you're not learning. Simple as that.

## Major Advice: Learn From People Who’ve Been There

**Don’t ask someone for advice on something they haven't done themselves.** If someone is talking about climbing mountains but hasn’t actually done it, walk away from that conversation.

### TL;DR:
1. Pick a language and learn OOP.
2. Practice on HackerRank.
3. Explore a domain you're interested in.
4. Make sure whatever you're learning correlates to a job role. (This will save lots of time) 
5. Use free resources like YouTube.
6. Learn by building projects.
7. Take advice only from people with real experience.

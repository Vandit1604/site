# How to Prepare for Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an exciting opportunity for students to dive into open-source projects, work with experienced developers, and contribute to real-world software. However, the process can be daunting, especially if you're new to open source. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you prepare and maximize your chances of being selected.

1. Start Early (July or August)
Preparation is key to succeeding in GSoC. Starting your preparation in July or August gives you ample time to understand the program, explore potential projects, and begin contributing. If you begin too late, you may not have enough time to learn the required technologies or make meaningful contributions.

2. Choose a Project that Aligns with Your Tech Stack
It's essential to select a project that matches your current skill set by about 50-60%. While GSoC is an excellent opportunity to learn new things, choosing a project that requires you to learn everything from scratch can be overwhelming, especially if you're starting late. By selecting a project that aligns with your existing knowledge, you can focus on deepening your expertise while also learning some new skills.

3. Research the Organization’s Selection Process
Once you've chosen a project, thoroughly research how the organization selects its GSoC students. Look at past successful proposals and the pull requests (PRs) of students who were selected in previous years. Analyze what they did right and how they contributed to the organization.

4. Review Last Year's Unselected Projects
Some projects might not have been selected in the previous year due to various reasons. These projects could be a priority in the upcoming year. Reviewing these projects can give you a head start and might even increase your chances of being selected.

5. Start Contributing
Contributing to open source can test your patience. It may take weeks, if not months, to get your first PR merged. Don't be discouraged by this. Take it one step at a time, and ensure you have a good understanding of the basic technologies used in the project.

6. Prioritize Your First Pull Request
Your first PR is crucial. It helps you familiarize yourself with the codebase and the contribution process. Make it your priority to get this PR merged. Once you've made your first contribution, you'll have more confidence and a better understanding of how to navigate the project.

7. Continue Contributing
After your first PR, continue to pick issues and solve them. As you progress, you'll likely encounter situations where you need to learn something new to solve a problem. Embrace this learning process, as it's a significant part of the GSoC experience.

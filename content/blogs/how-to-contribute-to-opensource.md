TODO: update this disclaimer with respect to job and skills if someone is contributing
> **Disclaimer:** It takes patience. Lots of it, when contributing to Opensource. If you don't have patience or time.Don't contribute to Opensource. It might be waste of your time if you chase the hype train. Instead, Build Tough Projects in place of contributing to Opensource. The point is to have some Proof of Work if you're looking for a job 

Getting started with open-source projects can feel overwhelming, but with the right approach, it becomes manageable. Here’s a straightforward guide to help you contribute effectively.

1. **Use the Project**
2. **Read the CONTRIBUTING.md**
3. **Check the most frequently updated files**
4. **Know the file structure of the repository**
Open source contributions take time, especially in the beginning. Getting your first PR accepted can take weeks, so don’t rush. Focus on:
   - **Frequently Updated Files:** These are often the most important in the project. Start by understanding these files.
   - **Use the Product:** Familiarize yourself with the product to understand what the code is doing.
   - **Take Notes:** Write down what you learn. Even if it’s rough, this will help you connect the dots later.

3. **Focus on Your First PR**

4. **Use Debugging Tools**

### Conclusion
Contributing to open source can take time, but it’s worth it. Start by finding a project that matches your skills, research how others contribute, and focus on getting your first PR accepted. Be patient and keep learning as you go. Your contributions will become easier with time.
